A set of files to do genomics analysis on python

[Here](https://github.com/brianpenghe/python-genomics/blob/master/DeepTree%20algorithm%20demo.ipynb) is a notebook to use DeepTree algorithm to "de-noise" highly-variable genes

A MATLAB implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/brianpenghe/Matlab-genomics)
